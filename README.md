# Analysis-of-Flight-Network
Short Description:
Analysis corresponded to network 14c in the dataset list by Tore Opsahl

Contents:
1) Code written in R
2) Variable Description text file

Description:

1) The number of flight entries after cleaning the data set are 7184.
2) Nodes are described by  airports  and the number of nodes in our data set are 3096.
3) Links are described whenever there exists a direct flight between the airports and the number of links in our data set  are 34174.
4) The network is naturally a directed graph where, in general, two directed links can exist between two nodes A and B, one describing the flights from A to B and one from B to A. 
5) The density of the graph is  0.007
6) The network is a giant connected component and there are several sub components.
7) The clustering coefficient of the network, which measures the probability that two neighboring nodes of a node ‘A’ will also be connected and hence forming a triangle is 0.25086.
8) For the unweighted network, the airport that has the highest centrality is Charles de Gaulle International Airport Paris.
9) Charles de Gaulle International Airport Paris has the highest connectivity as it has the most number of out going links which equal 470.
10) For the weighted network, the airport with the highest centrality is Beijing Capital International Airport, Beijing.
